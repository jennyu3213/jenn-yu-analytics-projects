# Jenn Yu – Analytics Projects

This repository contains my data analytics portfolio projects.

It showcases analytical work using tools such as **SQL, R, and spreadsheets**, applied to real-world datasets.  
Each project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, and clear communication of insights.

The repository is structured to support multiple case studies.  
Each project folder includes its own documentation and code detailing the analysis process and findings.

## Tools & Skills
- SQL
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate)
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Analytical reasoning

## Project Structure
- Each project is organized in its own folder
- Code and analysis files (e.g., `.Rmd`, `.R`, `.sql`) are included
- A project-level README explains the objective, data, and key insights

Additional projects will be added as this portfolio continues to grow.
